# MuRIL_finetuning
This repository contains finetuning of MuRIL for text classification.  

MuRIL is a BERT based model specifically trained for 17 Indian Languages. You can find more about it [here](https://tfhub.dev/google/MuRIL/1)

You can download train and dev dataset from [here](https://dravidian-codemix.github.io/2020/datasets.html). I have used Tamil dataset for experimentation purpose.
